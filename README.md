- Hi, I’m Derek. I am currently a university student studying Computer Science and Cybersecurity. I have a passion for programming and open-source software.
- School and work as a software development intern has consumed most of my time. So unfortunately I have not been able to work on passion projects.
- I plan on updating the application I have created in Java with JavaFX at some point when I get the time. I am always open to new opportunities where I can 
-   improve my skills or learn new languages and/or practices.
- Take a look at the project in my profile if you would like. Althoug it is somewhat old at this point and nowhere near a representation of my current skills. :)
